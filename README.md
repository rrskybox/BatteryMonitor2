A ClickOnce installation can be found in the "publish" directory.  Simply download and launch "setup.exe" as an uncredentialed installation.

This work by https://github.com/KrystianD for the decryption of the BM2 data and https://github.com/KreAch3R/bm2-oap for an initial example (in python) of how apply it.  Many thanks.
